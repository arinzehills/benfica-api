# BEN MORE E-Social Media API

This is a Node API  for a BEN MORE E-Social task platform. This app is a simple social platform where users can create and manage posts. Users can sign up, create posts with titles, descriptions, images, and statuses (In Progress, Completed, or Overdue). They can also comment on posts, like them, and assign posts to other users. Additionally, users can follow each other and view posts by the people they follow. The app provides APIs for all these actions, enabling a basic yet interactive social experience
